Continuous Assurance is a proactive approach to ensure network policies, connectivity, and security within a Kubernetes cluster are continuously monitored and verified. By leveraging the Netchecks operator and its NetworkAssertions, users can schedule automated network tests at regular intervals. This ongoing validation process helps maintain a high level of network reliability, security, and compliance, providing peace of mind and reducing the risk of unexpected network issues.
